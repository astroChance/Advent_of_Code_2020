    "attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through \n",
    "passport control.\n",
    "\n",
    "You write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the \n",
    "nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat \n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning \n",
    "to seat people. A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means \n",
    "\"front\", B means \"back\", L means \"left\", and R means \"right\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one \n",
    "of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells \n",
    "you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list \n",
    "of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front \n",
    "(0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which\n",
    "half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.\n",

    "For example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.\n",

    "The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one\n",
    "of the 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process \n",
    "as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep the \n",
    "lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.\n",
    "R means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.\n",
    "L means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.\n",
    "The final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.\n",
    "So, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.\n",
